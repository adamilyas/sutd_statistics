[Course Page](https://esd.sutd.edu.sg/courses/40004-statistics/)

The course provides an introduction to applied statistics and data analysis. The course will cover the following topics: collecting and exploring data, estimation and hypothesis testing, linear regression, analysis of variance and elementary methods in non-parametric statistics. Applications and examples based on engineering systems data will be given.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of the term, students will be able to:

- Examine data and use tools to visualize the data to uncover relationships
- Develop estimates and confidence intervals from a data sample; perform hypotheses testing and goodness-of-fit tests
- Build a regression model and estimate the parameters, and perform a diagnosis on the quality and validity of the model
- Design an experiment and conduct analysis of variance for a multi-treatment sample

## Measurable Outcomes
- Demonstrate working knowledge of statistical methods and tools
- Perform various types of data analysis: estimation, hypothesis testing, goodness-of-fit; regression; ANOVA
- Know what methods to use when for statistical inference and estimation
